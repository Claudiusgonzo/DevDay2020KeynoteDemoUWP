This sample contains a Contoso Travel app that is designed to work beautifully on a dual screen device as well as on desktop.

If you have the Windows 10X emulator (or a dual-screen device), you can depoly the app to it and see how the UI adapts to different device postures. You can deploy the same app to your Windows desktop too.
