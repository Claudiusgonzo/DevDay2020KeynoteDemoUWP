description: "A Contoso Travel app that's designed for dual screen devices"
---

# Official Microsoft Sample

This sample contains a Contoso Travel app that is designed to work beautifully on a dual screen device as well as on desktop.

If you have the Windows 10X emulator (or a dual-screen device), you can deploy the app to it and see how the UI adapts to different device postures. You can deploy the same app to your Windows desktop too.

## Prerequisites

This requires Windows 10, Visual Studio 2019 and a recent version of the Windows 10 Insider SDK (19559+). It's also recommended to install the Windows 10X Emulator.

## Setup

Simply clone, compile and run the app on desktop or on the Windows 10X Emulator.
